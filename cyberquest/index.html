Jump into the pool of several codes of varying difficulties. You don’t have much time, my friend! You will be awarded points on the basis of “who submits first”. So, pull up your socks before somebody else gets your points. In the end, the person with the maximum points wins the game.</p>

						5.Users are free to submit as many times as they want but remember only the last submission will contribute to the scoring. All the other submissions except the last one are skipped over and only the last one is judged at the end of the day. There is no additional penalty for incorrect submissions.<br><br>
						6.Scoring: Multipliers for each problem will be based on its difficulty level.<br><br>
						7.Base points for each problem will initially be 100.<br><br>
						8.The value of the base points you get for the day depends on the   number of penalty counts (PC) you receive for the day. Note that PC is a global entity and applies uniformly to all the users.<br><br>

						<p> Q: If I know just the basics of C/C++, am I fit for this event?
					A: You can definitely take part in this since the very interest in programming is the fundamental requirement for this event. Moreover the basic prototypes of the subroutines will be provided to you.<br><br>
			Q: Why should I participate in this very event?
				A: If you are fascinated by the concept of Artificial Intelligence, then this might be your stepping stone. It will help you to understand the basic concepts of data structure building, gaming techniques etc. Classes will be held for MNNIT students.<br><br>
				Q: What if I cannot complete my code?
				A: We are sorry to say that only a fully executing code can be accepted since it will be run on the judge. It is expected that the participants would have run their code at least once before hand. However, all the necessary help including the judge and building tips will be provided on time.<br><br>

										<div class="bb-custom-side page-layout-1">
											<p>Q: Being a first year student, I do not know much in Computer Science and its Applications. Will I be able to perform well in this event?<br>

					A: Yes.
					Even if you don’t know anything in computer science, you can perform well. All you need to have is just good Logical Ability and Reasoning Skills.<br><br>

					Q: If this event does not require any knowledge in Computer Science, then, why is this
					event under CyberQuest?<br>
					A: The reason for this event being under Cyberquest is that some problems that will be given in main rounds of the event will be related to Computer Science. But we will be checking your logical abilities and not your programming skills. We don’t expect technical stuff from you.
					<br><br>
					Q: Are all branches allowed?<br>
					A: Yes<br><br>

					Q: How do I need to prepare for interviews?<br>
					A: Interview round is meant to judge your thinking ability and your approach to various problems. Again, we would be emphasizing on logic and your thinking procedure, you can practise several puzzles from different sources for this round.<br><br>

					Q: I want to know more about the event. Where can I get additional information?<br>
					A: For any queries, you can contact the event coordinators.
