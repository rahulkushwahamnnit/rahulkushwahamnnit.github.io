                    	<p style="text-align:justify;">Electronic circuits might have taken a long time to be invented but they certainly did not take long to make their presence felt in all walks of life. Technophile’s have interjected that we have a need for “Electronics” .The last few decades have seen an out and out dominance of the silicon and its prodigious applications from small toys, to high end mobile phones & tablets ; from attractive & sophisticated gadgets to state-of -the art satellites .These have become an integral part of our existence, without which it would be difficult to imagine our lives.<br><br>

So, here comes the most awaited event of Electro-mania “Embedded Design” as the name suggests this  is an event to test your mettle in the field of Embedded Electronics. Which sets fire to your inquisitive spirits and intuitive mind in the field of  Electronics!!</p>

<br><br><br>No need to manually place gates and transistors to build electronic circuits. Electromania presents FPGA Design Challenge, for the electronic elite, who love to unravel the mysterious of the black box!
<br><br>Design complex circuits at an abstract level in terms of functionality and data flow by implementing those circuits in HDLs. ASIC prototyping with fpgas enables fast and accurate soc system modeling and verification as well as accelerated software and firmware development.
<br><br>Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are integrated circuits designed to be configured by the designer after manufacturing.
FPGA Design Contest requires one to write the code for the given problem statement in either VHDL or Verilog and optimize it, then dump the code on the FPGA Kit to physically realize the design that was coded.
So come and experience the dynamic energy in this offbeat synopsis of challenge</p>

<br><br>Round 1: Technical Exam
<br>This will be a written elimination round consisting of questions (MCQs and Subjective) related to electronic fundamentals and hardware.
<br>&nbsp;• Question sheets will be provided to the registered teams on a particular time.
<br>&nbsp;• They will have 2 hours to solve the questions and submit the answer sheets.
<br>&nbsp;• Answers have to be written on the same sheet.
<br>&nbsp;• There may be negative marking in some questions. Details will be specified in question sheet.
<br>&nbsp;• Selected teams will have to report for the next round.
<br><br><br>Round 2: Technical Interview 
<br>Teams that will qualify after the first round will be judged on the basis of Technical 
Interview. This will also be an elimination round. 

<br><br><br>Round 3: On Spot Circuit Design
<br>This is the final round in which set of components will be given to the qualified teams according to the tasks and they have to design a working circuit with them.
<br>&nbsp;•	All the components and required material will be provided to the teams.
<br>&nbsp;•	All teams will be having same kit of components.
<br>&nbsp;•	A total of 3 hours will be given to each team.
<br>&nbsp;•	You must design the circuit by using the components provided by us. You may not use any other component/material however in case something got damaged you may request the organizer to replace the components/parts.
<br>&nbsp;•	Teams should draw circuit diagram of the application depicting all the principles and theories involved in circuit as well as the working of the application on a sheet.
<br>&nbsp;•	Submitting the application/kits early will benefit the team as time bonus.
<br>&nbsp;•	Time bonus will be considered for tie-breaking between two or more teams.

<br><br><br>Sparkx and Avishkar invites all Tech enthusiasts to present their idea which can make this world a better place to live in. Don’t just dream of an idea, fight against all odds to bring your idea to life, who knows you might have a next million dollar idea, sometimes simplest ideas can be proved most effective. Genius is about creating ideas no one even imagined. Sparkx provides you the breeding ground of insane innovations and revolutionary ideas, a platform to bring out genius inside you.
<br><br>Sparkx is a paper presentation contest, paper to be presented should be based on original work/idea and directed to or based on some electrical or electronics phenomenon. Think long and hard and send us your entry at sparks.avishkar2k14@gmail.com</p>

						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="bb-custom-side page-layout-1">
						<p style="text-align:justify;">The arena consists of an LED matrix. At one end there will be the Terminator.
Zombies will enter the arena from the other end (min. 4 in a row and randomly)
and will move down the arena (upto 3 rows of LED matrix). You have to
generate a 4 bit(atleast) random number sequence. This number is used as
position of zombies in first row.Now after every clock pulse these positions will
shift to the row below, up to 3 rows (min) and the topmost row will be taken by
a new number generated .The position of the terminator can be controlled by
buttons representing Left and Right keys. Function of the terminator is to kill
the zombies. This you can do by clearing the LED which is in front of the
shooter position as fast as possible. If zombies succeed in crossing the lowest
row (atleast 3) then, the game will terminate. This will be indicated by a red
indiactor LED. If after a certain interval of time, no zombies are able to cross
the last row then a green indicator LED will be glown.
<br><br><br>Add Ons:
<br><br>Following features in your design can fetch you extra points and will be used to
resolve ties.
<br>&bull; Randomness in the zombies position in the first row.
<br>&bull; Make an alarm bell ring when the indicator LED turns red.
<br>&bull; Bigger size of LED matrix. (min 4X3).</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quintathlon is a mega five-round event that simulates placement scenario and judges all aspects of your personality as a technocrat and as an engineer.

<br><br><br>Round 1: 
<br>Written Round, Objective: 

<br>Questions on General and verbal aptitude, electrical, electronics and software skills followed by finite number of options to choose from. The objective of this round is to screen participants for further rounds.

<br><br>Round 2: 
<br>Written Round, Subjective:

<br>Questions that would require elaborate explanation or numerical calculations, analytical skills such as data interpretation, puzzles and program codes/algorithms would be asked to test basic concepts of electronics engineering.


<br><br>Round 3: 
<br>Surprise Round:

<br>Perhaps, the most happening and interesting round of Quintathlon & Electromania! And as the name suggests, the final details planned for this round would be disclosed on the spot.


<br><br>Round 4:
<br>Group Discussion :

<br>Any placement scenario would be incomplete without a group discussion. The normal format for the group discussion as followed by most companies for placement would be followed.


<br><br>Round 5: 
<br>Personal/Panel Interview: 

<br>The personal interview would include both the Technical and HR interview of the selected candidates.</p>
