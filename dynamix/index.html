<br>― Leonardo da Vinci
<br><br>Human has desired to fly from long ages. Going through the technological advancement, humans successfully achieved the century of flight-the 20th century. While AVISHKAR gives you an opportunity to look into your insight and a platform to come out with the best in you, we, at UDAAN give your desire the wings and launch pad to take you to the horizon which has no bounds.

<br><br>‘Avishkar 2k14’ calls upon the air-zealots to participate in ‘Udaan’. Use all your whacky ideas, design and fly aircraft and change the vision of human flight.

<br>Now is the time to start the show.
<br>The green flag flies & the engines roar,
<br>Racin’ down the track, door to door.
<br>Avishkar’14 brings to you AUTOMAX – RC Car event!!!
<br><br>It is time burn some rubber, it is time to race for cash, it is time to see people in the rear view mirror, it is time to let the engines roar. We are giving you a chance to build your own RC car and show everyone your need for speed 

<br><br><br>MISSION OBJECTIVE
<br>You are required to fabricate a miniature, remote controlled vehicle, powered by an Internal Combustion (IC) Engine that mimics a real life car and is capable of racing on an off-road dirt track paved by a varied range of obstacles.

						<p style="text-align:justify;">DAY 1
<br><br>Practice slots for the participating teams. First round would be a time trial round .This will be the qualifying session with each team getting 2 laps out of which the fastest lap will be considered. Note that these laps will have to be taken successively. <br>After that points will be assigned to top qualifying teams based on design and innovation parameters.
<br><br>DAY 2
<br><br>The top teams from the qualifying rounds will make it to the second round in which two teams will race at a time. Final result of every race after the qualifying round will be based on points earned in the race as well as the points earned for following the design specifications. Further elimination of contestants will take place according to the total points earned. Also race and design will have weightage of points in a ratio of 60:40. The top teams from this round will proceed to the 3rd round.
<br><br>DAY 3
<br><br>Top teams from the 3rd round will compete in the final round.

<br><br>&bull;	No request for practice slots shall be entertained after the first day. The slot, once allotted would not be rescheduled to a later time in any case.
<br><br>&bull;	The participants have to control their model car in the arena with the help of 2.4 GHz frequency remote control from a platform which is 10 feet above the ground. Only one team member is allowed to be on the platform.
<br><br>&bull;	If the car runs away from the track, topples or halts, the team member present on the arena can reset the car from the nearest check post. The member should keep the car behind the check post; time would be running during this.

						<p style="text-align:justify;">•	The maximum machine dimensions allowed are 800mm x 600mm x 400mm.
<br><br>•	The machine should only be propelled by an IC Engine of maximum capacity 4.6 cc. Other mechanisms such as throttling, braking, steering etc. can be controlled using DC motors and servos. The propulsion systems must not be based on DC motors.
<br><br>•	It is mandatory to have an on board power supply system to power the servos and at no point of time should the voltage of the power supply be greater than 13V.
<br><br>•	The machine should be controlled by a wireless remote control mechanism throughout the race. The remote control must use a frequency of band spectrum 2.4 GHz to avoid frequency clash during the event.
<br><br>•	Teams have to design and manufacture the following parts of the machine -Chassis, Steering mechanism (heim joints and the steering rods) and shock towers. You may also incorporate an anti-roll bar and impact attenuators (bumpers) for safety of your vehicles in case a collision occurs. Weight and wheel alignment will also be taken in consideration in the design round.
